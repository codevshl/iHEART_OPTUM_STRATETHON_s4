#### Problem Statements

• Pricing transparency and bring affordability in cost of care for long-term care 
patients (Chronic care diseases).

• Reducing hospitalization (and re-hospitalization) risk through the early
intervention program


 ## ```Problems Solved in Multiple Stages```

### First phase of webapp rollout 
  
  * [x] `Lifestyle based risk assessment` .
     - This prevents possibilities of hospitalisation with early intervention with user friendly interface anytime anywhere solving our first problem statement.

  * [x] `Hospitalization` (risks of unwanted incidents) [this too is a type of early interventions program] . 
     -  Cross verifies the possible heart disease in first step.
       - Can be monitised for making prediction if user isn't using our organisation's services.
       - Provide member user free prediction of possible heart disease and premium feature of classification of heart disease using our model.

### Second phase of webapp rollout
  
  * [ ] `Diagnostic` (risks of incorrect diagnostics) .
      - Provides various treatment packages considering competitors offers too and taking long term care of our patient for chronic disease which will solve our                second problem statement. 
      - Prevents possibilty of early discharge and eventually of re-admission/hospitalisation solving our first problem statement.
     
       
  * [ ] `Rehabilitation` (risks of rehabilitation defects) & provide proper care plan .
     - Devising appropriate patient-care plans for Rehabilation which will solve second problem statement.
 
  * [ ] `Customer Feedback`.
     - Accepting feedback from customers to improvise patient-care plans .

### Third phase of webapp rollout

  * [ ] `Re-hospitilazed patients` reason finding with the tracked data using IOT and patient history.

  * [ ] `Medical` (risks of surgical treatment, risks of pharmacotherapy, risks of undesirable medication reactions) .
