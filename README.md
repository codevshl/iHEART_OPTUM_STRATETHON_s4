## ***Problem Statements***

• Pricing transparency and bring affordability in cost of care for long-term care 
patients (Chronic care diseases).

• Reducing hospitalization (and re-hospitalization) risk through the early
intervention program


 ## ```Problems Solved in Multiple Stages```

### First phase of webapp rollout 
  
  * [x] `Lifestyle based risk assessment` .
     - This prevents possibilities of hospitalisation with early intervention with user friendly interface anytime anywhere solving our first problem statement.

  * [x] `Hospitalization` (risks of unwanted incidents) *[this too is a type of early interventions program]* . 
     -  Cross verifies the possible heart disease in first step.
       - Can be monitised for making prediction if user isn't using our organisation's services.
       - Provide member user free prediction of possible heart disease and premium feature of classification of heart disease using our model.

### Second phase of webapp rollout
  
  * [ ] `Diagnostic` (risks of incorrect diagnostics) .
      - Provides various treatment packages considering competitors offers too and taking long term care of our patient for chronic disease which will solve our                second problem statement. 
      - Prevents possibilty of early discharge and eventually of re-admission/hospitalisation solving our first problem statement.
     
       
  * [ ] `Rehabilitation` (risks of rehabilitation defects) & provide proper care plan .
     - Devising appropriate patient-care plans Provides care plans for Rehabilation which will solve second problem statement.
 
  * [ ] `Customer Feedback` (to keep check on services provided).

### Third phase of webapp rollout

  * [ ] `Re-hospitilazed patients` reason finding with the tracked data using IOT and patient history.

  * [ ] `Medical` (risks of surgical treatment, risks of pharmacotherapy, risks of undesirable medication reactions) .

 

 #### CODE FLOW FOR PREDICTION MODEL
``` >>>>
1. Add data using CSV file.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Data Cleaning and Normalising.
4. Data Visualisations using different Data Plot types.
5. Split Data in two parts. 
  - Training Data.
  - Testing Data.
6. Train model.
7. Evaluate the model using following Algorithms:
  - Random Forest.
  - KNN.
  - SVC.
  - Logistic Regression.
    > Found Random Forest most accurate with Accuracy = .99, Recall = .98, F1 Score = .99, Precision = 1.00. 
8. Read CSV file or Manual Data from user.
9. Predict using our Model.  ```
