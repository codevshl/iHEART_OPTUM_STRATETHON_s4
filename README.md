 ## ```Problems Solved in Multiple Stages```

### First phase of webapp rollout 
  
  * [x] `Lifestyle based risk assessment` .
     - This prevents possibilities of hospitalisation with early intervention with user friendly interface anytime anywhere.

  * [x] `Hospitalization` (risks of unwanted incidents) . 
    - Cross verifies the possible heart disease in the first step.
    - Can be monetised for making predictions if the user isn't using our organisation's services.
    <u> Provide member users with the free prediction of possible heart disease and a premium feature for the classification of heart disease using our model. </u>

### Second phase of webapp rollout
  
  * [ ] `Diagnostic` (risks of incorrect diagnostics) .

  * [ ] `Rehabilitation` (risks of rehabilitation defects) & provide proper care plan .
  
  * [ ] `Customer Feedback` (to keep check on services provided).

### Third phase of webapp rollout

  * [ ] `Re-hospitilazed patients` reason finding with the tracked data using IOT.

  * [ ] `Medical` (risks of surgical treatment, risks of pharmacotherapy, risks of undesirable medication reactions) .
